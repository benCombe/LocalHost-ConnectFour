How To Use:

- Both Players must select 'Start Game'
- Play will commence with the first Player who connected


Notes:
I created a compound configuration in my IntelliJ, you might have to do the same with Server + C4Terminal + C4Terminal2
& for looking at the GUI, Server + C4Terminal + GUI.

The GUI does work for playing against a CPU, If you want to play against a CPU with the terminal, use 'C4Test'

Also, the GUI doesn't show the move you just made until after the other player/cpu makes their move
